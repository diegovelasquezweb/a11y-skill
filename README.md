# Web Accessibility Audit Agent Skill

Perform automated accessibility audits that empower AI agents to resolve issues with data-driven precision. This skill generates structured technical data including selectors, code evidence, and remediation logic, allowing AI to identify and patch WCAG 2.2 AA violations directly in your codebase with targeted remediation and minimal manual oversight.

## Key Features

- **Engineered for LLMs** — Generates a remediation guide specifically optimized for AI agents. It groups issues by route to eliminate context-switching, drops heavy markdown tables to save tokens, and injects strict guardrails to prevent agents from editing compiled code.
- **Zero-Config Route Discovery** — Point it at a URL and it crawls. Finds same-origin pages automatically, no sitemap or route list required.
- **Failing Element Screenshots** — Violations with a single, identifiable element automatically get a screenshot captured and embedded in the HTML report.
- **Accessibility Emulation** — Test dark mode, forced colors, and reduced motion via Playwright — the scenarios real users with disabilities rely on.
- **WCAG 2.2 Manual Check Coverage** — Six criteria axe-core can't detect are covered with step-by-step verification instructions built into the report.
- **Runs Without an Agent** — Drop it into CI/CD directly. `pnpm run audit -- --base-url <url>` runs the full pipeline, no AI tokens required.

## Installation

To install this skill, provide the following prompt to your AI agent:

## How to Use

Once installed, the skill is available to your agent in any conversation. Simply ask:

> "Audit my local dev server at `http://localhost:3000`"

> "Check accessibility for `https://mysite.com`"

## Deliverables

- **Location**: All reports are generated in the `audit/` directory.

### For Clients & Stakeholders

- `report.pdf`: A professional, formal document designed for offline sharing and compliance evidence.

### For Developers & PMs

- `report.html`: A premium, interactive React-like dashboard that features:
  - Persona impact mapping (Screen Readers, Cognitive, Motor) to help prioritize UX improvements.
  - Critical issue isolation with ready-to-use code solutions for fast remediation.

### For AI Agents & Automation

- `remediation.md`: Actionable, token-optimized remediation guide for AI agents — contains selectors, HTML evidence, code fix templates, and agent instructions for resolving each issue without exhausting context windows.
- `internal/`: Raw technical assets for data ingestion.
  - `a11y-findings.json`: Final normalized findings (Cleaned).
  - `a11y-scan-results.json`: Raw automated scan data (Full).

## Standalone CLI

**Best for:** CI/CD pipelines and local automation without spending AI tokens or agent intervention.

Execute the audit script directly from the skill directory:

```bash
# Local dev server
pnpm run audit -- --base-url http://localhost:3000

# Live site
pnpm run audit -- --base-url https://mysite.com
```

## Audit Pipeline

All steps are orchestrated by `run-audit.mjs`, which executes them in sequence:

1. **Preflight**: `check-toolchain.mjs` verifies local dependencies and browsers.
2. **Scan**: `generate-route-checks.mjs` crawls the site and runs Axe-Core.
3. **Process**: `deterministic-findings.mjs` transforms raw data into structured findings.
4. **Build**: `build-audit-html.mjs` generates the final HTML dashboard and the AI-optimized `remediation.md`.
5. **Export**: `generate-pdf.mjs` creates a portable PDF version of the report.

## Advanced Configuration

Customize the audit by editing `a11y.config.json` in the skill root.
