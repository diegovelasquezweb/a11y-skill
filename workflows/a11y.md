# Accessibility Audit Workflow

1. **Target Identification**: Ask the user for the base URL of the site to audit (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
2. **Execution**: Run the audit pipeline:
   ```bash
   node scripts/run-audit.mjs --base-url <URL>
   ```
3. **Capture**: Identify the `REPORT_PATH` from the command output.
4. **Reporting**:
   - Provide the absolute path to `audit/report.html`.
   - Summarize the number of Critical, High, Medium, and Low findings.
   - Suggest a specific fix for the most severe issue found.
