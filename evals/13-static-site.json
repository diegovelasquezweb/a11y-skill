    "Completes the audit without requiring framework detection or package.json",
    "Does NOT assume a JS framework is present — framework_detected should be null or 'unknown'",

    "Correctly proposes inline HTML fixes (adding alt attributes, label elements) not JSX or component syntax",
    "Loads references/source-patterns.md and correctly identifies .html files as the target for fixes",
