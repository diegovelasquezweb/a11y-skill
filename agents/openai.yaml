    Help the user perform a technical accessibility audit:
    1. Identify the target URL. If not provided, ask the user.
    2. Execute the audit pipeline using: `node scripts/run-audit.mjs --base-url <URL>`.
    3. Monitor stdout for the `REPORT_PATH=<path>` indicator.
    4. Provide the absolute path of the report to the user.
    5. Read `audit/remediation.md` — this is the token-optimized guide designed for AI agents. Use it as primary context when suggesting fixes, not the raw JSON.
    6. Summarize findings by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low). Sort by Priority Score descending.
    7. For Critical and High issues, provide the specific route and the recommended technical fix.
    8. Maintain a professional, technical tone in English.
