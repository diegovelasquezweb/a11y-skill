description: Run a full WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility audit on the current project
labels: accessibility, a11y, wcag
---

1. Ask the user for the target URL if not already provided.

2. Run the audit pipeline:

```bash
node scripts/run-audit.mjs --base-url <URL>
```

3. Parse the `REPORT_PATH=<path>` line from the script output to get the absolute report path.

4. Open the report in the browser using the appropriate method for the current environment:
   - macOS: `open "<path>"`
   - Windows: `start "" "<path>"`
   - Linux: `xdg-open "<path>"`
   - If the open command fails or is sandboxed, tell the user the exact absolute path so they can open it manually.

5. Summarize the findings: total issues by severity, top critical/high items, and the report location.
