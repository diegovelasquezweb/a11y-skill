# Accessibility Remediation Rules

When helping with code fixes, always check if an accessibility audit has been performed recently in the `audit/` directory.

## Instructions for Cursor

1. **Context First**: Read `audit/internal/a11y-findings.json` to understand the technical root cause of any reported violations.
2. **Surgical Fixes**: Use the `selector` and `failureSummary` from the findings to locate the exact line of code.
3. **WCAG Compliance**: Do not suggest fixes that violate WCAG 2.2 AA standards. Refer to the MDN links provided in the findings.
4. **Remediation**: For detailed fix patterns, read `audit/remediation.md` — it contains AI-optimized instructions grouped by route.
5. **Verification**: After applying a fix, ask the user to re-run the audit (`node scripts/run-audit.mjs --base-url <URL>`) to confirm the violation is resolved.
