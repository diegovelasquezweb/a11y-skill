description: Run a full WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility audit
---

1. Ask the user for the target URL if not already provided.

// turbo 2. Run the audit pipeline:

```bash
node scripts/run-audit.mjs --base-url <URL>
```

3. Parse the `REPORT_PATH=<path>` line from the script output to get the absolute report path.

4. Open the report in the browser using the appropriate method for the current environment:
   - VS Code / Cursor / any IDE with shell access: run `open "<path>"` (macOS), `start "" "<path>"` (Windows), or `xdg-open "<path>"` (Linux)
   - If the shell open command fails or is sandboxed, tell the user the exact absolute path so they can open it manually.

5. Summarize the findings: total issues by severity, top critical/high items, and the report location.
